# My Awesome Wu-Tang Project
This project is a wutang name generator based off 5 true or false questions.

## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

When the DOM loads we set constant variables to our button, all inputs, all inputs that are label true and our arrays that are storing our string of wu-tang names. This application will give your wu-tang once the user answers all of the questions by checking true or false and then clicks the submit button.

When the button is clicked, our function fires by checking if the inputs on the DOM have been selected, if not then an alert will pop up to ask the user to answer every question. If the user answer every question true then he will get a wu-tang, else if the user does not he will get a regular, non wu-tang name.

## Optimization

Still learning to check if the minimum 5 inputs have been selected before it can generate a name. Still work on the bugs, an update will come later.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned to use JavaScript new methods of coding. This was good practice to use the new methods being applied to the EJS6 being used in today JavaScript coding practice, from using anomoynous functions when the button is clicked to using ticks to display our string text and the ${} to display our value in strings.
